# Calibration Protocol

1. Place reflective targets at **5 cm**, **15 cm**, and **30 cm** from the HC-SR04 face.
2. Use a **metal ruler** aligned to the sensor axis as the reference.
3. For each distance, record at least **10 readings** and compute the mean.
4. Note ambient **temperature (Â°C)** and **humidity (%)** for each set.
5. Repeat the procedure under **extreme** environmental conditions (e.g., warm & humid).
